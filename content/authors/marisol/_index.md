**Hi there!** :wave::smile: I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics at the [Univeristy of Granada](https://www.ugr.es). My research interests include the analysis of immunological receptor repertoire sequencing (Rep-Seq) and applications of Artifical Intelligence methods to Bioinformatics. Currently, I also teach medical students how to use Molecular Biology databases to study genetic diseases. I enjoy sharing scientific knowledge to broader audiences with [BioinformaticsGRX](https://bioinformaticsgrx.es/).
